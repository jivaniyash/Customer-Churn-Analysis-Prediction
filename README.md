This folder cantains files to process the bank churner's sample data for finding out the answers.

[Phase-1.twb](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction/blob/master/Phase-1.twb) is tableau file used to perform EDA and some of the useful insights is shown in [Team_Green_Phase_1.pdf](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction/blob/master/Team_Green_Phase_1.pdf). 


[Phase 2](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction/blob/master/Team_Green_Phase_2.pdf) demonstrates Model Selection, Spliting, Cross-Validation, Training & Testing Data set & [Phase 3](https://github.com/jivaniyash/Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction/blob/master/Team_Green_Phase_3.pdf) file is individual created for prediction of new unseen records using Neural Neowrk Model and put recommendations to the Very Nice Bank!!
